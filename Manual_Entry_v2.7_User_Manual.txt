1. INTRODUCTION
============================================================

The Manual Entry app v2.7 is a comprehensive data collection system designed for athletic measurements and roster management. It provides a touch-friendly interface optimized for iPad use, with offline capability and local data storage.

KEY FEATURES:
• Offline Operation: Works without internet connection after initial load
• Local Data Storage: All information saved securely on your device
• Double-Entry Validation: Ensures accuracy through confirmation entries
• Flexible Units: Choose metric or imperial units per measurement
• Adjustment System: Apply systematic corrections to measurements
• Export Capabilities: Generate CSV files for data analysis
• Session Persistence: Resume work exactly where you left off

============================================================
2. GETTING STARTED
============================================================

INITIAL SETUP:

1. Launch the Application
   - Open the app in Safari on your iPad
   - For best experience, add to Home Screen for app-like functionality

2. Enter Operator Information
   - Your Name: Enter the name of the person collecting data
   - Event Name: Provide a descriptive name for this measurement session

3. Upload Roster
   - Click "Import Roster (CSV)" and select your participant file
   - See Roster Requirements section for proper format

4. Proceed to Setup
   - Click "Next: Setup Measurements" to configure measurement parameters

ROSTER REQUIREMENTS:

Your CSV file must contain the following columns in this exact order:

ID,Name,Gender
001,"John Smith",M
002,"Jane O'Connor",F
003,"Mike Johnson",M

COLUMN SPECIFICATIONS:
• ID: Unique identifier (can be numbers, letters, or blank for new entries)
• Name: Full participant name (use quotes if name contains apostrophes)
• Gender: M (Male), F (Female), or Other

IMPORTANT NOTES:
• First row must contain column headers exactly as shown
• Names with special characters should be enclosed in quotes
• Gender affects which adjustment values are applied to measurements
• File must have .csv extension

============================================================
3. MEASUREMENT SETUP
============================================================

UNITS CONFIGURATION:

Configure measurement units for each category before starting data collection:

Height Measurements: Inches (default) or Centimeters
Jump/Distance Measurements: Inches (default) or Centimeters
Weight: Pounds (fixed)
Hand Measurements: Inches (fixed)

ADJUSTMENT SYSTEM:

Adjustments are systematic corrections applied to all measurements based on equipment calibration, environmental factors, or standardization requirements.

HOW ADJUSTMENTS WORK:
1. Gender-Specific: Different adjustments for Male (M) and Female (F) participants
2. Additive: Adjustments are added to raw measurements
3. Automatic: Applied during data collection and export
4. Measurement-Specific: Each measurement type has its own adjustment value

AVAILABLE ADJUSTMENTS:
• Height with Shoes - Standing height wearing shoes
• Height without Shoes - Standing height barefoot/socks
• Reach - Standing reach measurement
• Wingspan - Arm span measurement
• Weight - Body weight
• Hand Length - Wrist to fingertip
• Hand Width - Palm width
• Vertical Jump - Maximum vertical leap
• Approach Jump - Running vertical leap
• Broad Jump - Standing horizontal jump

SETTING ADJUSTMENTS:
1. Enter values in the Measurement Adjustments table
2. Use positive numbers to add to measurements
3. Use negative numbers to subtract from measurements
4. Default value is 0 (no adjustment)
5. Adjustments automatically save when changed

EXAMPLE: If your measuring tape consistently reads 0.5 inches low due to equipment calibration, enter +0.5 in the appropriate adjustment field to correct all measurements automatically.

============================================================
4. DATA COLLECTION
============================================================

MEASUREMENT PROCESS:

1. Select Participant
   - Click on a participant card from the roster grid
   - Card will expand to show measurement interface

2. Enter Measurements
   - Each measurement requires two identical entries for validation
   - Enter the first value and press Enter or Tab
   - Enter the second value to confirm
   - Values must match exactly to save

3. Save Process
   - Measurements auto-save when both entries match
   - Green highlighting indicates successful validation
   - Red highlighting indicates entry mismatch

MEASUREMENT DEFINITIONS:

Height with Shoes: Standing height wearing shoes
- Technique: Participant stands straight against wall, shoes on

Height without Shoes: Standing height barefoot or in socks
- Technique: Participant stands straight against wall, no shoes

Reach: Standing reach (fingertip height)
- Technique: Participant reaches up with dominant hand

Wingspan: Arm span (fingertip to fingertip)
- Technique: Arms extended horizontally, measure tip to tip

Weight: Body weight in pounds
- Technique: Standard scale measurement

Hand Length: Length from wrist to fingertip
- Technique: Measure from wrist crease to middle fingertip

Hand Width: Width across palm
- Technique: Measure across widest part of palm

Vertical Jump: Maximum vertical leap from standing
- Technique: Standing jump, measure highest point reached

Approach Jump: Maximum vertical leap with running start
- Technique: Running approach jump, measure highest point

Broad Jump: Standing horizontal jump distance
- Technique: Standing position, jump forward, measure distance

CALCULATION DETAILS:

Adjusted Value Calculation:
Final Value = Raw Measurement + Gender-Specific Adjustment

Unit Conversions:
• All calculations performed in inches internally
• Display units converted based on your selection
• Height displays include feet/inches format (e.g., "6' 2"")

VALIDATION RULES:
• Both entries must be identical to the decimal place
• Values must be positive numbers
• Empty entries are allowed (saves as blank)
• System prevents impossible values (e.g., negative measurements)

============================================================
